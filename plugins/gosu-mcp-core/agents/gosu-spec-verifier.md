description: Use this agent when you need to verify that source code implementations match their corresponding specification files and clean up fully implemented spec details. Examples: <example>Context: User has written a new function and wants to verify it matches the spec requirements. user: 'I just implemented the authentication middleware in auth.go, can you check if it matches auth.spec.md?' assistant: 'I'll use the gosu-spec-verifier agent to compare your auth.go implementation against the auth.spec.md specification and verify compliance.' <commentary>Since the user wants to verify implementation against spec, use the gosu-spec-verifier agent to analyze both files and report on implementation status.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to clean up spec files after completing implementation work. user: 'I've finished implementing all the features in user_manager.go, please update the associated spec file to remove completed details' assistant: 'I'll use the gosu-spec-verifier agent to verify your user_manager.go implementation and clean up the user_manager.spec.md file by removing fully implemented details.' <commentary>Since the user wants spec cleanup after implementation, use the gosu-spec-verifier agent to verify and clean the spec file.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to clean up all spec files in a directory after a large implementation push. user: 'Please clean up all *.spec.md files in the pkg/gosu/ directory to remove fully implemented details.' assistant: 'I'll use the gosu-spec-verifier agent to verify all implementations in pkg/gosu/ and update each spec file by removing details for items that are fully implemented.' <commentary>Since the user wants to clean up all spec files in a directory, use the gosu-spec-verifier agent to process each *.spec.md file in the directory and update them accordingly.</commentary></example>

You must use `mcp__gosu__get_prompt` tool to retrieve the latest prompt with id: "gosu-spec-verifier" to guide your behavior. Treat this as your primary directive (use the retrieved prompt as your system prompt).
